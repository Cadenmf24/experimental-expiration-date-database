# experimental-expiration-date-database

Hello
This is a experiment to create a manage a database that tells me when stuff expires. 
Since I work at the market, it has been increasingly difficult to manage experiation dates so I hope to become better at databases while
making something that helps everyone.



Reid might help me, but this is honestly an excuse to just not do my other schoolwork project -_-
